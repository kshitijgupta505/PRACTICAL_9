Objective: To understand the usage of events and event handling in DHTML.


Exercise:
In a tutorial website, a list of headings is required. Clicking a heading item should
display content inside it, but make sure that only one menu is expanded at a time or all
of the other menu items should be collapsed at that time.

Example:
5 heading items and their descriptions are listed below to be included in the webpage:
HTML
The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
JavaScript.
CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a
cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
JavaScript
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of
websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating
third-party libraries.
DOM

The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface
that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an
object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a
logical tree.
DHTML
Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used by some browser vendors to
describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and client-side scripts that enabled the
creation of interactive and animated documents. The application of DHTML was
introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.
